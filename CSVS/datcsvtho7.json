By the process of rethinking on the perspective, Jagruti Vikas Trust has also decided to expand its work through establishing field centers and sub centers. The approach of jagruti vikas trust has been to mobilize the marginalized communities and make them aware of their rights and entitlements by forming and strengthening their community based organization such as women self help groups and village development committees. These cbos raise various issues that are the root cause of the disempowering and marginalization of their community of the area. The local resource persons were identified for providing issue-based awareness to the cbos. They were identified and the leaders were trained on related issues like nrega, food entitlements, right of women to own land and property etc. Jagruti vikas trust is working with an overall mission to develop self-reliant communities through a self-help approach particularly for women. Our strategy includes implementing programs on improving economic status, holistic health and hygiene, strengthening the earning capacity of women.

Women\u2019s and girl\u2019s situation is hardly understandable for outsiders. But tbe born as a daughter a women has restrained from education, socialization and participation in the decision making process. As a wife, a woman sadbhavna charitable trust has tprocreate children for the husband and rear them. She has the obligation tprocreate a baby child? failure would result in deprivation of conjugal life with the husband. Still there are many other forms of mental violence against women. Moreover, beatings and other forms of physical violence are considered as normal practices in the hillvillages. When girls or young women get married, alsthey are not supposed tstay with their birth family. They are considered tlive with the husband\u2019s family. This leads tthe opinion, that investment on girls education is useless because it does not give any return tthe parents. Hence, often the boy child alone enjoys the investment on education and development. This discrimination leads the girl tgrow as illiterate, ignorant and inferior persons, which turn out in poverty and a submissive status. Health condition health condition in the targeted villages is comparatively poor and needs more attention by the government as well as by the nongovernmental organizations. However, a number of factors put the population of the target areas both at special risk for the poor health plight. These factors include population density, rudimentary housing, dwindling ways of making a living, poor sanitation and health care systems and lagging literacy and education. Tribal people have also traditionally been isolated from the rest of the district and are at the bottom of the region\u2019s socioeconomic ladder. Morbidity, mortality and frequency of illness are much higher among the targeted villages and coastal communities and particularly among women, than in the rest of the district. Literacy and education the targeted community alslags behind the general population of gujarat in literacy rates and education levels. If they send the children tschool at all, most families stop the education of their children early, as the industry has the tendency tabsorb young workers in large numbers and they find themselves unable tdsbecause of their lack of education and alternative skills."},{"Name of NGOs":"Sajjata Sangh, Ahmedabad","Address":" C\/o Development Support Centre, Marutinandan Villa, Nr.

Aaradhana was founded in 2002 by renowned hindi poet and satirist from agra shri pawan aagri with the aim to organize events and campaigns on social issues. Dr (mrs) hirdesh chaudhary an educationist, social activist and writer joined Aaradhana after resigning from her government job to work for upliftment of nomadic children in 2010. Subsequently, Aaradhana was registered on 26.11.2010 under rule 21 of society?s act 1860 in agra with the aim to work for educational upliftment of underprivileged and disadvantageous sections of the society. Initially, Aaradhana started with awareness campaigns and events in the form of kavi sammelans touching most critical social issues such as female feticide, communal tensions, illiteracy, etc. Aaradhana has been organizing all indiakavi sammelans and mushairas to maintain peace and harmony in the city of taj. Aaradhana has been organizing female literacy meets through Aaradhana lekhika manch to provide a platform for budding female writers and housewives to express their views on various issues concerning society and the nation. Aaradhana has adopted 15 primary government schools in akola block where it has focused its attention to provide clean drinking water and toilet facilities for boys and girls. Aaradhana has got 4 schools equipped with drinking water and toilet facilities through indian oil corporation limited. Such facilities will soon be provided in other schools as indian oil has already approved these projects. Aaradhana started spreading its wings to educate the most neglected sections of the society through its prestigious mission shiksha bane jeevan jyoti. It focused its attention to educate gadhiya luhar community whose literacy rate is a big zero and where none of ngos work. There are ngos working for educating children from slum areas but we find hardly anyone to teach these nomadic children. Aaradhana has been giving education to nomadic children of agra for past one and half years. This initiative to teach nomadic children with unique methodology and solid determination has got it wide media publicity and appreciation from many organizations and the up government too. Social impact of this educational initiative is visible as the society which thought education as a big barrier to their traditional profession, has started realizing its failure to obtain and apply education to lead a dignified life like all other indian citizens. Aaradhana took the initiative to get them voter cards so that they can also take part in elections and their voices are heard in this country. Aaradhana has made nomadic tribes to take pride as equally responsible people having some fundamental rights to impact social and democratic processes in this country."},{"Name of NGOs":"Aaradhya Foundation , Dahod","Address":"3\/A, Tulsi, Opp.Jain Temple, Mahavir Nagar, Hadka Mill Road, Godi Road","City":"Dahod","Pin Code":"389151","State":"Gujrat","Mobile No(s).":"Mobile : 98989 68596, 84908 50123 Tel :","Email":"aaradhyafoundationdahod@gmail.com","Website":"Website :","Name of Contact Person":"Contact Person : Arpil Shah","Purpose":" Agriculture, Anti Drug Campaign, Art And Craft, Art And Culture, Awareness Generation, Child Labour, Child Rights, Child Welfare, Consumer Issues, Corporate Social Responsibility, Cow Protection Centre (Goushala), Cultural Heritage., Cultural Issues, Development (General), Distance Learning, E-Governance, E-Learning, Economics And Finance, Education, Employment, Environment, Fair Trade, Food And Nutrition, General \u2013 Social Welfare, Governance, Grants\/Aids, Group Promotion, Health, Hiv\/Aids, Human Development, Human Rights, Indigenous Knowledge, Information And Communications Technology, Infrastructure, Labour, Legal Awareness, Livelihood, Medical Relief, Rural Development, Science And Technology, Social Awareness, Right To Information, Trade And Industry Welfare, Traditional Health, Trafficking Of Women, Training, Tribal Development, Tribal Issues, Urban Development, Women Development\/Welfare, Women\u2019S Issues, Youth Swachh Bharat.","About":"Aim\/Objective\/Mission : Our this year objective is kuposhan mukt dahod & swachh dahod."},{"Name of NGOs":"Aarambh Ek Suruaat Educational & Welfare Society, Samastipur","Address":"Add: C\/o Sri Sita Ram Mahto, Patalia","City":"Samastipur","Pin Code":"848211","State":"Bihar","Mobile No(s).":"Purpose: Social welfare and educational revolution.

This could prove encouragement enough for them to pursue their music as well as the rewards and recognition could inspire the new generation to dedicate time for their folk music. We believe that for improving music, welfare of musician is a precondition. A few singing forms are at the verge of extinction. This is because there are no more exponent of these styles. There are only three singers that sing the ancient singing form ? waai. The musical instrument ? soorndho is no more played in this part, although a couple of artists have potential to cultivate the skills. But the changing life style results in a situation that the artists spend minimal time after their music. A need is strongly perceived to bring musicians and singers on a platform.
