By the process of rethinking on the perspective, Jagruti Vikas Trust has also decided to expand its work through establishing field centers and sub centers. The approach of jagruti vikas trust has been to mobilize the marginalized communities and make them aware of their rights and entitlements by forming and strengthening their community based organization such as women self help groups and village development committees. These cbos raise various issues that are the root cause of the disempowering and marginalization of their community of the area. The local resource persons were identified for providing issue-based awareness to the cbos.

Women’s and girl’s situation is hardly understandable for outsiders. But tbe born as a daughter a women has restrained from education, socialization and participation in the decision making process. As a wife, a woman sadbhavna charitable trust has tprocreate children for the husband and rear them. She has the obligation tprocreate a baby child? failure would result in deprivation of conjugal life with the husband. Still there are many other forms of mental violence against women. Moreover, beatings and other forms of physical violence are considered as normal practices in the hillvillages. When girls or young women get married, alsthey are not supposed tstay with their birth family. They are considered tlive with the husband’s family. This leads tthe opinion, that investment on girls education is useless because it does not give any return tthe parents. Hence, often the boy child alone enjoys the investment on education and development. This discrimination leads the girl tgrow as illiterate, ignorant and inferior persons, which turn out in poverty and a submissive status. Health condition health condition in the targeted villages is comparatively poor and needs more attention by the government as well as by the nongovernmental organizations. However, a number of factors put the population of the target areas both at special risk for the poor health plight. These factors include population density, rudimentary housing, dwindling ways of making a living, poor sanitation and health care systems and lagging literacy and education. Tribal people have also traditionally been isolated from the rest of the district and are at the bottom of the region’s socioeconomic ladder. Morbidity, mortality and frequency of illness are much higher among the targeted villages and coastal communities and particularly among women, than in the rest of the district. Literacy and education the targeted community alslags behind the general population of gujarat in literacy rates and education levels. If they send the children tschool at all, most families stop the education of their children early, as the industry has the tendency tabsorb young workers in large numbers and they find themselves unable tdsbecause of their lack of education and alternative skills."
